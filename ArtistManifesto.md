# BitsyProject

The intention of my game is to bring awareness to how careless we have been and continue to be to our planet and its creatures. We often will step on others on our path to evolution without even realizing the effects it may have. Species of Animals and plants have gone extinct. Forests have been demolished, burned, and chopped either due to our carelessness or because we needed what they offered, whether that be food, shelter, or anything else. My game has the player start out in a peaceful forest, undisturbed for now, with animals and plants all around. Then as you leave the forest, you see a town development. It's small but still growing. As you play through, you will see how the settlement expands as it slowly destroys more and more of the natural life. Each time you jump forward in the settlement's lifespan, the effects on the environment will get exponentially worse. 

The game is also to help my skills with the bitsy engine. I tried to use many somewhat advanced features to make the game interesting. Just to name a few, heres a list of some of the added features.

Multiple Endings

Custom Art (Some being multisprite)

Multiple animations and characters to interact with

spliting diaglog options based on items in hand
